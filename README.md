# OOP_Project
3rd Year Object Oriented Programming Project

You are required to implement a multi-threaded file server and logging application that allows
a client application to download files using a set of options presented in a terminal user interface

There is four options to choose from
-1 - connect to the server
-2 - show all files listing
-3 - download files
-4 - quit

I have added a text file with various information to links that i used in order to help me with my project.
